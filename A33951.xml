            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHether the Above-mentioned Paper were drawn up, or ſo much as ever ſeen, Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or

                  <hi>I having been now above five Years in Priſon, and, what is more grievous to me, lain ſo
long under a Falſe and Injurious Calumny of an Horrid Plot and Deſign againſt your
Majeſties Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and am now by the Diſpoſition of Gods Providence called

Neceſſary for me as an Incumbent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I owe to Truth, and my own Innocency, to make this
Enſuing Proteſtation to your Majeſty and the whole World; That whereas One</hi> Titus Oates
<hi>hath maliciouſly and falſly Sworn, That he ſaw me Receive a Commiſſion Directed to me

                  <p>1. Touching my Lord <hi>Petre</hi>'s Guilt or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, I meddle not; He is gone to his place:
But this I will ſay, That the Contrivers of this Letter might however have had more manners than
to Call a Legal Impeachment in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Court of Judicature of this Kingdom, <hi>A falſe

cannot Determine,) Depends firſt on the Truth of this Paper's being the Lord <hi>Petre</hi>'s own
handy work, which we have already Detected of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Symptomes of Forgery, and till that be
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clear'd, it can be of no Force at all; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to add to the Suſpition of his Guilt, if
it ſhould prove Forg'd; for Innocence never deſires its Friends ſhould invent Shams or Lies

Real, 'Tis only a Dying Romaniſts word in his own Caſe, and wherein the Reputation of his

                  <p>3. In this Proteſt, there ſeems a Fallacy or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation in the very Words, For he
ſpeaks of <hi>Oates</hi>'s having Sworn that He (the Lord <hi>Petre</hi>) received a
Commiſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Paragraph ſmells rank of a Popiſh Prieſts Contrivance, being the higheſt Affront
imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſince it not only openly Arraigns the Government, the Wiſdom, the Juſtice of the
Nation, but in effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, his Sacred Majeſty <hi>(horreſco referent!)</hi> ſeveral
Parliaments, all our Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be all Fools or Madmen. But ſo far is it from
Truth, That any ſober men are Convinced of the Folly or falſhood of Mr. <hi>Oat</hi>'s
Evidence, That it ſtands ſtill unſhaken by all the little Arts the Romaniſts have uſed to
ſupplant it, and firm as the Pillars of the Earth (for ſo is every Truth.) Whereas true it is
on the other ſide all ſober men cannot but obſerve the Numerous Calumnies and Subornations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Which the Papiſts have ſet on foot to Blaſt <hi>Oats</hi>'s Credit,
have been abundantly detected by Providence to their Confuſion, and are legible in our Records to
all future Generations, as in the Caſe of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane, &amp;c.</hi>—And what
need was there of ſuch Helliſh Artifices, if their Cauſe durſt have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heaven and
Truth, and Innocence in the Face?</p>
                  <p>But we may rationally make Judgment of the whole Paper by that which follows; For he that will
Avouch with the higheſt Aſſeverations one Notorious Untruth, cannot expect to be believed in
his other Affirmations, by any that are not Bankrupt of Reaſon, and too prodigal of their
Faith.</p>

                  <p>What an Innocent Loyal parcel of Folks would this man perſwade us, his Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
conſiſts of! Never, alas, was Prince Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, Never Arms taken up by them
againſt their Soveraigns upon the Account of Religion!—Their Church only Excommunicates a
Prince, and gives him to the Devil a little, and depoſes him from his Crown, if he will not
believe and do as ſhe would have Him; And then if any zealous Son of the Church ſhall think fit
to Kill him, this is no Murthering of a King, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Prince, according to her
Doctrine, any longer a King, nor the Act Murther, but doing of Juſtice on an Enemy to God and the
Church. Nor does ſhe allow Subjects to take up Arms againſt their Soveraigns, only ſhe
Abſolves them from their Allegiance when ſhe thinks meet, and thenceforwards they ceaſe to be
Subjects, and their King to be their Soveraign.—What Sots, what Dolts, what ignorant not
obſerving Cockscombs does the Author of this Libel fancy us Engliſhmen to be? Or how could he
have the Impudence to Addreſs this ſtuff to that Sagacious Majeſty, who both by the Works and

bold Averment to be either wholly deluſive, or utterly falſe. I.</p>
                  <p>For what does this Author mean by his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick-Church?</hi> Or by an <hi>Authoriz'd
Principle?</hi> If by Church, he intends the Pope, whom they call the <hi>Church Vertual,</hi> and
whom all of their Communion are bound to obey; how many Kings has he depoſed? how many
Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nations Commanded, Encouraged or Abetted? as againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
the two laſt <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt in
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where the Popes Nuntio was in the Head of the Rebels? If by Church, he
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands <hi>Councils,</hi> acknowledged by them lawful and general, whom they call the
<hi>Church Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative;</hi> They have Juſtified, approved and Commanded this Depoſing
Rebellious Doctrine, As the Council of <hi>Lions</hi> and their great <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Council,
held in the year 1215. in which (if they miſreckon not) there were no leſs than 1215. Fathers;
where it was Synodically and Categorically Concluded, <hi>The Pope might depoſe Kings, abſolve
their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, and give away their Kingdoms.</hi> If by
<hi>Authoriz'd Principle,</hi> he means the Dictates of their Canon Law, (the Rule whereby their
Church acknowledges to be governed, and holds in a manner equal to Sacred Scripture) there we find
the ſame things aſſerted. If the Judgment of their moſt famous Divines, and Caſuiſts in
their Books, unreproved, unſentenced, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, may together with concurrent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and

finding either what that Church is, or what it maintains.</p>
                  <p>But here again we meet with another Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation—Aſperſions (as he calls them) thrown
on the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church, of which he knowingly affirms there is nothing more

                     </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church—Very true; but nothing to his purpoſe; Such
Principles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deteſted by the Catholick Church, that is, by all ſincere real<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Members of Chriſt; but ſtill 'tis as true, that nothing is more plainly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or practiſed
by the Apoſtatiz'd Politick Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood that call themſelves the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who
are indeed Members of Antichriſt, and the Synagogue of Satan. And this our Author ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
acknowledges, by dropping there the word <hi>Roman,</hi> whereon the whole Hing of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
depended.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there any thing more abſurd than his Suggeſtion in the following Clauſe; That his
Church deteſts it as being expreſly contrary to the Command of our Saviour, and Chriſtian
Doctrine; For is not his Churches denying the Cup to the Laiety, forbidding Prieſts Marriage,
Injoyning Prayer in an Unknown Tongue, and many other Tenets, as expreſly contrary to the Command
of our Saviour and Chriſtian Doctrine? And yet they are not aſhamed not only to practiſe, but
inforce them, under the higheſt Penalties.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Our Author makes the Lord only ſay, That he deteſts it <hi>as ſuch;</hi> that
is, As far as 'tis contrary to Chriſtian Doctrine: But what if with the Popes, the Councils, the
numerous Doctors of his Church before-mentioned, he believ'd Killing or Riſing in Arms againſt
an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Prince, not to be Murthering of a King, or Raiſing Rebellion againſt his
Soveraign, according to Chriſts Command, when his (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
<pb facs="tcp:98955:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Vicar requires it, and declares it lawful; Where
then is the Kings Safety, or the Papiſts Loyalty?</p>
